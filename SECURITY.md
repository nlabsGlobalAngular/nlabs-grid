## Security Best Practices

When using @nlabs/grid:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm update @nlabs/grid
   ```

2. **Sanitize User Input**
   - The grid uses `bypassSecurityTrustHtml()` for trusted HTML
   - Never pass unsanitized user input to custom templates
   - Always validate data from external sources

3. **Content Security Policy**
   - Configure CSP headers appropriately
   - Allow inline styles if using dynamic theming

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper auth for CRUD operations
   - Validate permissions on the server-side
   - Don't rely on client-side validation alone

## Known Security Considerations

### HTML Sanitization
The grid uses Angular's `DomSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml()` for developer-controlled HTML content. This is safe for:
- ‚úÖ Static HTML templates
- ‚úÖ Developer-defined content
- ‚úÖ Trusted data sources

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never** pass user-generated content without sanitization.

### Custom Templates
When using custom cell templates:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ SAFE - Static content
<ng-template gridCellTemplate="name" let-row>
  <strong>{{ row.name }}</strong>
</ng-template>

// ‚ö†Ô∏è UNSAFE - User-generated HTML
<ng-template gridCellTemplate="html" let-row>
  <div [innerHTML]="row.userGeneratedHtml"></div>  <!-- DON'T DO THIS -->
</ng-template>

// ‚úÖ SAFE - Sanitized
<ng-template gridCellTemplate="html" let-row>
  <div [innerHTML]="sanitize(row.userGeneratedHtml)"></div>
</ng-template>
```

### Data Export
When exporting data:
- Validate data before export
- Be aware of formula injection in Excel/CSV
- Sanitize special characters

## Disclosure Policy

- Security issues will be disclosed publicly after a fix is released
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- We follow responsible disclosure practices
